Tony is a bar owner, with covid19 he can no longer meet his expenses so he is looking for Ludus students to make him a programme for free.
Tony knows that he will be confronted with using a program in console mode, but he doesn't care.

What he wants is this:
Every day he receives pallets with bins of beer from his supplier.
The Leffe contains 12 bottles, the Jupiler contains 24 bottles, the Paix-Dieu 8 bottles and the Orval only 6.
He would like to get a program that allows him to see his stock and margins in real time. Because the problem is that his supplier sometimes supplies bins with bottles that do not always contain the same number of cl. This means that sometimes he will have 25cl bottles, sometimes 33cl and if he is lucky he will get 50cl bottles. He doesn't know this information in advance, but he can see from certain deliveries that there is sometimes a difference.

He also sees that his charges vary according to the quantity as these are the supplier rates:

Orval:
25cl tub 10.8€.
33cl tub 15€
50cl tub €22

Leffe
25cl tub €15.3
33cl tub €24
50cl tub €36

Paix dieu:
25cl jug €17.6
33cl tub €24
50cl tub €40

Jupiler:
25cl tub: €10
33cl tub: 14€ (€)
50cl tub: 21.2€.

Tony knows that he can sell Orval and Paix-Dieu at double the purchase price.
On Leffe and Jupiler he is happy with a 45% return on resale.

So he would like to get a main menu where he can:
1) add bins of beer to the stock.
2) see his stock of bottles and their volume.
(he has just stocked several bins, here are the details: 2x Jupiler 33cl, 3x paix dieu 25cl, 1x paix dieu 50cl, 1x orval 33cl, 1x orval 25cl)
3) see his current capital (knowing that he has 200€ currently)
4) sell a beer of the customer's choice
5) leave
